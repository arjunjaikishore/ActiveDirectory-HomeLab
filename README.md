# üìíüåê Active Directory Home Lab

## Description
This is my Active Directory home lab where I set up a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller and a Windows 10 client in VirtualBox. I configured AD DS, DNS, and DHCP to mimic how a real corporate network works. I also created a domain (`mydomain.com`), added organizational units, and made user accounts that could log into the client machine. Along the way, I practiced troubleshooting DNS and ensuring domain-joined clients could resolve and access external domains like google.com.

### Technologies Used
- Windows Server 2019  
- Windows 10  
- VirtualBox (NAT + Internal Network)  
- Roles: AD DS, DNS, DHCP  
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)  

## Walk-through

**1. Promoted the Server to a Domain Controller** ‚Äì Installed AD DS, created the domain `mydomain.com`, and gave the DC a static IP (`172.16.0.1`).  

**2. Configured DHCP Scope Options** ‚Äì Set the DC to hand out IP addresses, default gateway, and DNS to clients.

**3. Set DNS Forwarders** ‚Äì Configured Google (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) so external name resolution works.

**4. Tested DNS on the DC** ‚Äì Verified that the Domain Controller could resolve google.com using `nslookup`.

**5. Created Users and Organizational Units** ‚Äì Added sample accounts in Active Directory Users and Computers (e.g., test users) to simulate how IT teams manage employees.  

**6. Joined the Windows 10 Client to the Domain** ‚Äì Connected Client1 to `mydomain.com`, then logged in using the domain user profile I created.

**7. Verified Client IP Settings** ‚Äì Client1 successfully pulled the correct IP, gateway, and DNS from DHCP.

**8. Checked Client-DC Connectivity** ‚Äì Confirmed Client1 could ping the Domain Controller.

**9. Verified External Connectivity** ‚Äì Client1 resolved and pinged google.com through the DC‚Äôs DNS forwarders.

**10. Logged in as a Domain User** ‚Äì Restarted Client1 and logged in with a domain user account created in ADUC.

## What I Learned
- I learned how to promote a Windows Server to a Domain Controller and create a domain from scratch.  
- I practiced managing users and groups in Active Directory Users and Computers.  
- I saw how DHCP, DNS, and AD all work together to support domain-joined clients.  
- Fixing a DNS misconfiguration through DHCP scope options showed me how important proper configuration is.  
- This lab gave me a hands-on look at how corporate IT environments handle identity, authentication, and network management.
